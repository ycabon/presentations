Maquette
=========

Maquette is a Javascript utility which makes it easy to synchronize the DOM tree in the browser with your data.
It uses a technique called 'Virtual DOM'.
Compared to other virtual DOM implementations, maquette has 3 advantages:

* It is very lightweight (3.6Kb gzipped)
* It allows changes to be animated
* It is optimized for speed

## Notes

This is a custom version of maquette for the JS API based on version 3.3.4. It has the following modifications:

* Automatically sanitizes `innerHTML` content with [`arcgis-html-sanitizer`](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-html-sanitizer) (see [`projection.ts`](https://devtopia.esri.com/WebGIS/arcgis-js-api/blob/3e7c098ceb3fcc7529ab5aaa3261432cd29a1244/esri/libs/maquette/projection.ts) for more info)

Modifications are denoted by a `// âš  JS API customization` comment.
