                        **WebGL-Engine: Render Passes**
                           Version 0.1, ablumer@esri.com

The system consists of multiple components. Approaching it in a top-down fashion, we have
the [RenderPassManager](#RenderPassManager), which maintains a set of individual [RenderPasses](#RenderPassClass).

The higher level code can then provide objects implementing `IRenderSubmitSystem` and register them with 
the [RenderPassManager](#RenderPassManager). The manager will then call back to every submit system, giving 
them a chance to submit draw calls for the next frame to the appropriate passes.

Finally, when it's time to render a specific pass, the RenderPassManager will dispatch it. 

RenderPassManager
=================================================================

An instance of this lives on the `RenderView`. It contains a set of all provided [render passes](#RenderPassClass).
In the final design its responsibility will be to coordinate in what order things get 
rendered into which render targets. Currently it is implemented as a `RenderPlugin`, called by the legacy
`Renderer`. The goal is to move more and more render code over to use the `RenderPassManager` and eventually 
have it replace the `Renderer`.

Exposed passes
=================================================================
ShadowMapPass
:  Renders shadow casting objects. This queue might be dispatched multiple times, once for each shadow map 
   cascade.

MaterialPass
:  The main pass for rendering opaque objects. Potentially contains multiple sub-passes for additional
   render targets, in which case the queue will be dispatched multiple times.

   SubPasses are:
    - ColorSubPass
    - DepthSubPass
    - NormalSubPass

HighlightPass
:  Special pass for objects rendering into the highlight buffer. This is managed as a separate queue because 
   typically the number of objects highlighted is far smaller than the number of total objects.

Please note that different passes usually use different `PassParameters`. For example the highlight pass does
not expose the scene lighting, as it should be irrelevant in that case.
 
RenderPass class
=================================================================
At it's most basic, a `RenderPass` is a list of draw calls that can be added to, sorted, and dispatched to
the GPU.

Submission to a pass is an abstract, highly templated interface, defined in `IRenderPassSubmit`. 
It contains all information required to later dispatch the draw call to the graphics card:
- a material (see [ISubmitMaterial](#ISubmitMaterial))
- a geometry
- parameters specific to the draw (such as model transforms)
- a depth hint (for sorting)

ISubmitMaterial
=================================================================

The main responsibility of `ISubmitMaterial` is that given a set of parameters, it returns a 
[ShaderTechnique](#ShaderTechnique) suited to the task.

The `passParams` identify and configure the pass to render in.
The `geometryParams` specify the configuration of the geometry to render, such as vertex attributes present.

ShaderTechnique
=================================================================

`ShaderTechnique` is a replacement for `GLMaterial`. At it's simplest it is a combination of a `Program` and a 
`RenderPipelineState`, plus the interface to bind it at various stages during rendering.

The three functions of the binding interface will be called at different granularity:
- once per pass
- on every material change
- on every draw call

A ShaderTechnique is inherently immutable, with its state solely defined by the `Configuration` provided
during construction.

`ShaderTechniques` are created and destroyed via the `ShaderTechniqueRepository`.
