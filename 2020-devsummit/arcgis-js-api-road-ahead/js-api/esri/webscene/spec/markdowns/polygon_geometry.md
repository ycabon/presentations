**Referenced by:** [geometry](geometry.md)

### Properties

| Property | Details
| --- | ---
| hasM | Indicates whether the geometry contains M coordinate values.
| hasZ | Indicates whether the geometry contains Z coordinate values.
| rings | Represents an array of rings. Each ring is an array of points.
| [spatialReference](spatialReference.md) | The spatial reference can be defined using a well-known ID (WKID) or well-known text (WKT).
