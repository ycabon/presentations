# polylineGeometry

Contains an array of paths and a spatialReference.

**Referenced by:** [geometry](geometry.md)

### Properties

| Property | Details
| --- | ---
| hasM | Indicates whether the geometry contains M coordinate values.
| hasZ | Indicates whether the geometry contains Z coordinate values.
| paths | Three nested array levels describing a polyline. The first level describes individual paths; the second describes the points of these paths; and the third gives the coordinates of the points.
| [spatialReference](spatialReference.md) | The spatial reference can be defined using a well-known ID (WKID) or well-known text (WKT).
