# popupElement

Popup elements allow users to author popups, using multiple elements such as tabular views, string description, media (charts and images), and attachments of the attributes and control the order in which they appear. Specifically, popupElements do the following: 1) provide the ability to explicitly add a field/ value table in addition to a description, 2) allow adding multiple description elements, and 3) allow a user to author and consume elements of a popup in the order of their choosing.
