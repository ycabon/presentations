# WMS Layer (WMS)

A layer consuming a Web Map Service (WMS). The WMS specification is an international specification for serving and consuming dynamic maps on the web.

**Referenced by:** [baseMapLayer](baseMapLayer.md), [operationalLayers](operationalLayers.md)

### Properties

| Property | Details
| --- | ---
| copyright | A string containing copyright and access information for a WMS layer. This is copied from the capabilities document exposed by the WMS service.
| customLayerParameters | A sequence of custom parameters to WMS layer requests. These parameters are applied to `GetMap` and `GetFeatureInfo` requests. The `customLayerParameters` property takes precedence if `customParameters` is also present.
| customParameters | A sequence of custom parameters to all WMS requests. These parameters are applied to `GetCapabilities`, `GetMap`, and `GetFeatureinfo` requests. If used with the `customLayerParameters` property, `customParameters` will not take precedence.
| extent | The minimum bounding rectangle, in decimal degrees, of the area covered by the layer as specified in the capabilities.
| featureInfoFormat | Format of the feature, e.g.`text/plain`
| featureInfoUrl | The URL for the WMS GetFeatureInfo call.
| format | A string containing the image format to be requested from a WMS service. Default is `png`.<br>If property is present, must be one of the following values: <ul><li>`bmp`</li><li>`gif`</li><li>`jpg`</li><li>`png`</li><li>`svg`</li></ul>
| id | A unique identifying string for the layer.
| isReference | This is applicable if used as a baseMapLayer. A boolean value indicating whether or not the baseMapLayer draws on top (true) of other layers, including operationalLayers, or below (false).
| itemId | Unique string value indicating an item registered in ArcGIS Online or your organization's portal.
| layerType | String indicating the layer type.<br>Value of this property must be `WMS`
| [layers](wmsLayer_layer.md) | An array of layer objects from the WMS service.
| listMode | To show or hide the sublayer in the layer list. If the layer has sublayers, selecting `hide-children` will hide them in the layer list.<br>If property is present, must be one of the following values: <ul><li>`hide`</li><li>`hide-children`</li><li>`show`</li></ul>
| mapUrl | A string containing the URL of the WMS map. When using a WMS layer, you should also supply the url property. `mapUrl` is the URL returned by the capabilities to be used for the getMap requests.
| maxHeight | A number defining the maximum height, in pixels, that should be requested from the service.
| maxScale | A number representing the maximum scale at which the layer will be visible. The number is the scale's denominator.
| maxWidth | A number defining the maximum width, in pixels, that should be requested from the service.
| minScale | A number representing the minimum scale at which the layer will be visible. The number is the scale's denominator.
| opacity | The degree of transparency applied to the layer on the client side, where 0 is full transparency and 1 is no transparency.
| refreshInterval | Refresh interval of the layer in minutes. Non-zero value indicates automatic layer refresh at the specified interval. Value of 0 indicates auto refresh is not enabled.
| showLegend | Boolean value indicating whether to display the layer in the legend.
| spatialReferences | An array of numbers containing well-known IDs for spatial references supported by the service.
| title | A user-friendly string title for the layer that can be used in a table of contents.
| url | The URL to the WMS service (`getCapabilities` URL).
| version | A string containing the version number of the service.
| visibility | Boolean property determining whether the layer is initially visible in the web map.
| visibleLayers | An array of layers that should appear visible. The array contains the names of the visible layers.
